# Portfolio
Each branch in the github is a diffrent project, There is a total of two project in the portfolio. 
# Project 1 (Boggle Game)
I coded each method in both hashmap.c and linked list.c to make sure spellcheck work, matching whatever word produced to a word in the dictionary. I then load the dictionary into the hashmap and tranverse it. Using recursion method I have the boggle have limits using diffrent base cases, comparing the current words to the last word made, while seeing what is visited.
# Project 2(Cat and mouse Simulator)
